---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.8.0
Date: 03.01.2022
  Changes:
    - Added support to 2 new ores in Mad Clown's Extended BobAngel Ores (Meta-Garnierite and Nova-Leucoxene).
    - 
    - Updated DE locale, mostly.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.7.1
Date: 04.03.2021
  Changes:
    - Fixed ADCMD sometimes disabling itself even when there is enough electricity. Thanks for reports helping debug this in https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/60298868aeb4c6fd76f93752 .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.7.0
Date: 01.03.2021
  Changes:
    - Added support for brevven's Lead mod https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead from his own pull request.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.6.0
Date: 20.02.2021
  Changes:
    - Unofficial support of Space Exploration Ores, Beryllium, Cryonite, Holmium, Iridium, Naquium, Vulcanite, Vitamelange, infinite ore patches will spawn and yield ore or chunks depending on the miner used.
    - If supported ore probability is 0 it won't be refined from Deep Core Ore so Space Exploration ores can only be found on their planets and with Advanced Deep Core Mining.
    - Might be not tested bugs with Naquium only spawning in space and DCMD not placeable in space, I'm not that far yet :)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.5.1
Date: 28.11.2020
  Changes:
    - Fix missing locale for new pollution configurations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.5.0
Date: 28.11.2020
  Changes:
    - Update compatibility with Factorio 1.1.
    - Fixed demo sounds not longer being separated.
    - Reviewed pollution as it is now a fixed value at maximum consumption and not scaling depending on enery usage anymore.
    - Added a mod setting to set pollution for moho, deepcore and advanced deepcore mining drills, respective defaults : 200, 500, 1000.
    - Added support for Titanium ore from https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium (thanks pull request from brevven : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5fbb77fc382d8d2ab69e23ab )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.4.0
Date: 13.11.2020
  Changes:
    - All mining drills now use double energy usage : Moho 1 > 2MW, DeepCore 5 > 10MW, Advanced > 20MW. Halved the pollution emission per energy, so it remains the same as before but beware if you crank it up !
    - Drills energy usage is now available as a startup configuration in mod settings.
    - Deep Core Cracks spawning chance and group size variations are both map configurable in mod settings. Only new spawn will be affected obviously.
    - Ore patch spawning chance and minimum distance are not map configuratble in mod setting. Only new spawn will be affected obviously.
    - Removed the allow beacon around drill setting, it was not doing anything anymore as code was removed some time ago. Functionnaly still works as modules effects are limited on drills anyway.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.3.2
Date: 28.08.2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed electric mining drill animation smoke function wrongly overriding vanilla one that was actually deadcode (thank for report and analysis in https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5f42e6ed5f4fe08ba57f66d4 )
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.3.1
Date: 15.08.2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed editor mode not triggering build events used to hotswap ore patches for moho or deepcore miner (raw ore / chunks). It now triggers a full check of all miner when entering / exiting editor mode.
    - Seems to also fix some cases where hotswaping wasn't working even when placing a miner normally.
    - Bumped factorio version to 1.0 :tada:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.3.0
Date: 13.08.2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed patches spawning too close when one is already converted to a chunk/ore type by ploting a miner. Also in the case of two different types of ore close to each other. Now any type of ore patch can only spawn when none are already close by.
    - Added a new DeepCore Refining recipe without Uranium. Made the normal one a bit cheaper to compensate.
    - Added compatibility with Mylon's Prospector mod, Deep Core Patches will only spawn on depleted prospected ores now (Contribution from Darkshadow44).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.2.2
Date: 06.08.2020
  Changes:
    - Speed and productivity modules removed from all DCMDrills, wrecks balane and doesn't add meaningful gameplay. Can still use speed on refining though.
    - This solves beaconing spam around drills !
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.2.1
Date: 04.08.2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed all Deep Core recipes sorting in production inventory.
    - Fixed ADCMD requiring 50 DCMD to be built, now 50 Vanilla Electric Mining Drill instead. Also reviewed all DCMDrills costs to be more coherent.
    - Fixed Krastorio 2 Rare Metals Chunks refining locale.
    - Fixed Krastorio 2 Rare Metals patch yielding smelted raremetal, now outputs raw rare metals as it should.
    - Moho Update (2.2.0) basic integration into DE locale, some texts kept in english until I can get a proper translation (contributions welcome !).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.2.0
Date: 04.08.2020
  Changes:
    - New Moho Mining Drill, outputs normal ore but mines slowly (like DCMD previously in 1.x versions, about 10x Vanilla Electric Mining Drills and less than half a DCMD).
    - o Player can now chose the simple to place Moho Mine but only get slow ore mining or invest in the DCMD with lot of ore but require new infrastructure and logistics investment.
    - o Reviewed technologies, Deep Core Mining now only unlocks the DCMDrone and the new Moho Mine. Chunk refining will come with the DCMDrill tech.
    - Minor fix to the DCMD gfx.
    - Clean up unused entity assets, reduces the mod size a bit.
    - Fixed chunk refining Uranium probability output to 1% (from 0,5%) as it was rounded to 0.
    - Fixed deep chunk refining recipe time to 8s from 50s as intented (doesn't change balance just reduce machine number needed).
    - DCMD and ADCMD are a bit more expansive to build.
    - DCMD now require 5MW (from 1MW). Progression is now Moho 1MW, DCMD 5MW, ADCMD 10MW. Not like it should matter at that level but they are hungry machines !
  Balance:
    - ADCMD reduced chunks production a bit (2 100/m from 2 800/m). Should be less chunks to handle for roughly the same output.
    - ADCMD chunks refining, now use 100 chunks + 20 acid and outputs 100 ore chunks (from 200 and 50 and 100 respectively).
    - ADCMD chunks refining replaced probability output by consistent ratioed output. More consitant and easier to balance.
    - ADCMD focused chunks refining boosted a bit.
    - Removed productivity from refining recipes.
    - Overall, a bit less deep chunks, more raw ore output in both normal and focused deep chunks refining.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.1.0
Date: 02.08.2020
  Changes:
    - Rebalanced Iron, Copper, Stone, Coal, Uranium ratios for Deep Core Ore refining to be close to the 1 000 SPM ratios roughly 50% Iron, 40% Copper, 7% Stone, 6% Coal. Uranium is even lower with 0,5%.
    - For modded ore ratio balance, I'll need more feedback, only vanilla ratios are changed.
    - Rebalanced Chunks refining to compensate for the heavy infrastructure investment, it now output much more ore.
    - o Refining time reduced so it requires much less chemical plant machines : 1 Chemplant for 2 DCMD (before it was 4 chemplants to 1 DCMD), 2 Chemplants for 1 ADCMD (was 8 per 1 before).
    - o Ore patches mining time increased to 12 (from 2) to balance.
    - o Results in a Chunks to ore produced ratio now 8 (was 0,33 before), means your get 8 ore for 1 chunk.
    - o Results in 1 DCMD (+ 0.5 chemplants) = 20 Vanilla Electric Mining Drills (was 5 before) worth of ore produced before modules.
    - Reduced sulfuric acid required for chunks refining by 80% (base for iron from 100 to 20) for all chunks refining.
    - All Deep Core Mining Drills and Chunk Refining can now be productivity and speed moduled to further encourage investment in Chunks Refining.
    - Rebalanced Focused Chunks refining to be more viable now rougly 150% of the single ore yield from normal Deep Core Chunks Refining.
    - Deep Core Crack now spawn by groups of 2 to 5.
  Graphics:
    - Revisited the ore chunks items icons GFX, should be less confusing and still have variations.
    - Deep Core Ore now also use Chunks variations icons with golden tint.
    - Deep Core Crack GFX review, now more smooth and has 6 variations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.4
Date: 19.07.2020
  Changes:
    - Fix crash on ADCMD energy interface checking, thanks for the report and save to reproduce the bug by Hardjagg in https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5f119bb78aaa2c42fc9d1607
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.3
Date: 10.07.2020
  Changes:
    - Fix last ontick update trigger not working.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.2
Date: 10.07.2020
  Changes:
    - Improve ontick update spike for ADCMD, should be much less noticable now. Will only do something when ADCMD are actually built and remembers a list of ADCMD to update their energy status if needed.
    - Removed the Beacon Prevention Feature as drills are already effect limited and code wasn't working anymore anyway.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
Date: 07.07.2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed DCM recipes being used for raw materials calculation (allow-decompostion set to false to refining recipes), thanks mrudat.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.0
Date: 02.07.2020
  Changes:
    - MAJOR MECHANIC CHANGE ! To prevent too much frustration with this new version, all DCMD are disabled and must be replaced manually.
    - DeepCore drill has a custom remanent in the unlikly scenario where it gets eaten by the local fauna.
    - DeepCore drill now outputs ore chunks that must be refined instead of directly usable ore.
    - Advanced DeepCore mining drill now smokes when mining.
    - Advanced DeepCore mining drill is now animated when mining.
    - Advanced DeepCore drill now require DeepCore Mining Drones as "fuel" and doesn't require sulfuric acid anymore. Drones have 120MJ energy, drill uses 10MW resulting in a mining cycle requiring 3 drones.
    - Advanced DeepCore drill efficiency modules now reduce the DeepCore mining drones usage, but electricity usage stays at 10MW.
    - Deep Core Ore now must be refined like other ore chunks, in a chemical plant with sulfuric acid (previously it was in a centrifuge with DeepCore Mining drones).
    - Major rebalance for mining and refining as follow : 
    - Balance goal is still a low but infinite source of ore as fields depletes around the factory and be able to reuse the infrastructure at the cost of replacing drills and setting up a refining facility.
    - DeepCore Mining drill is about half the mining power of 10 mining drills as raw ore output for double the energy and refining steps on its unlocking productivity level (20%).
    - A single DeepCore Mining drill uses half a yellow belt throughput on average before productivity.
    - Advanced DeepCore Mining drill is about two third the mining power of a DeepCore mining drill as raw ore output (so 30% as powerful of 10 normal drills) and requires two stages of refining and more than 10x the energy.
    - As Advanced DeepCore Mining consumes mining drones and lot of acid for refining, it require good productivity on the whole supply chain to be a small net positive on raw ores.
    - A single Advanced DeepCore Mining drill uses 3/4 of a blue belt throughput on average before productivity. 
    - Focus refining is about half as efficient as normal deep core refining (produces half the output, require 1,5x the chunks) but you can choose the raw ore.
    - Acid usage for refining has been reduced a lot with the rebalance.
    - Made colored chemical plant smokes when refining deepcore chunks more colored.
    - Reduced mining drills sounds volume more. Again. Should be loud enough now.
    - Added an upgrade code to place new feature with existing Advanced drills.
    - Upgrade code also explains the major breaking changes to players to make them aware of the impact on existing factories.
    - Source code reorganisation to help maintainability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.22.0
Date: 18.06.2020

    - Added support to new mods ores kindly provided by DarkShadow44 https://github.com/DarkShadow44
    - Leighzer's Morphite : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/leighzermorphite
    - Pyanodons Raw Ores : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pyrawores
    - Pyanodons Coal Processing : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/pycoalprocessing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.20.1
Date: 17.06.2020
  Changes:
    - Made a whoopsy, fixed iron, copper, coal, stone and uranium missing custom patch icons.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.20.0
Date: 17.06.2020
  Changes:
    - Fixed pollution emission of deep core mining drills, they were emitting none, DCMD emits 100 and ADCMD 1000 per minute as intended.
    - Reduced DCMDrills sound volume a bit.
    - DCMD don't require a pump to inject fluid anymore, was more confusing than anything.
    - Added machine working tint for refining to all ores according to their ore tint, makes colored chemical plan smokes according to the ore refining.
    - Improved some icons from 32px to 64px, DCMD, ADCMD, DCMdrone, tool and ores.
    - All deep core ores items now use the generic deep core ore chunk icon that is partly tinted to the ore.
    - Generic tinted deep ore chunk have now 8 new variations for items in the world (in belts and droped on the ground).
    - Added support for Krastorio 2 Rare Metals ore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.19.0
Date: 30.01.2020
  Changes:
    - Upgrade to 0.18 compatibility.
    - Fixed typo in locale for Gold.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.18.0
Date: 10.10.2019
  Changes:
    - Added raise_built and raise_destroy when deep core ore patches are created by mining or removed by the deep core mining planner for better other mods support through theses native events (thanks to the suggestion made by Rampant mod author https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5cdcab6514ee39000ce0ad62).
    - Marked Industrial Revolution as explicitly incompatible for now. May be supported later but as it is an heavy overhaul mod, I can't make any promise.
    - Added prerequist of Production Science and Utility science on some Deep Core Mining techs (mostly cosmetics, shouldn't change the tech tree workflow of Deep Core Mining much).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.17.5
Date: 08.04.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed changelog for good ! Thanks again Pi-C.
    - Removed the decorative regeneration in 1.16.4 migration as it could add decoratives even on concreted tiles. Most 0.17 experimental saves affected should be fixed by now and removing it will prevent polluting more saves when 0.17 becomes stable. If you really want to fix deorative, it's possible from the in-game console.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.17.4
Date: 06.04.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed multiple output recipe being forbidden for ore chunk refining with Bob's ore gems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.17.3
Date: 06.04.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed multiple output recipe being forbidden for ore chunk refining. Big output may be challenging to empty fast enought for the machine to not stop, multiple Stack inserter or a single Deadlock's Express loader can do it. Thanks for fix provided by Png85 https://github.com/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/issues/5 .
    - Tentatively fixed changelog for it to be properly parsed and displayed in-game. It's apparently a science field : https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=67140 .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.17.2
Date: 15.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Adjusted pollution generation of drills with 0.17.13 mechanic change (DCMD emmits 10x an electric drill (100/s from 150/s), ADCMD emmits 100x an electric drill (1000/s from 1500/s)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.17.1
Date: 10.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed debug still enabled.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.17.0
Date: 10.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Added Support to Quartz ore from https://mods.factorio.com/mod/SimpleSilicon
    - As Quartz mining require water, Deep Core Quartz Mining require 400 water for 4 ore from a Deep Core Quartz Ore Patch.
    - Some refactor to support mod's ore that have a different mining result than the resource name. Don't hesitate to report regressions especially on supported mod's ores.
    - Fixed Ore Patch Mining that require fluid to mine couldn't be mined because it required more fluid than the Deep Core Mining Drill could hold for Uranium. Now require 400 liquid instead of 1000 for 4 ore.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.16.4
Date: 07.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed decoratives being removed from the whole map instead of just around deep core cracks when they spawn (on tile discovery). Thanks for report https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5c7fec54bad30c000d2947ab .
    - Made a migration script to regenerate all the decoratives from all surfaces in existing games.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.16.3
Date: 05.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Made the dependancy to 0.17.5 required as changes are not retro compatibles.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.16.2
Date: 04.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed compatibility with Factorio 0.17.5 that refactored mining productivity that was a prerequist to Deep Core Mining. Cost should be the same.
    - Deep Core Mining requires Mining Productivity lvl1 (from 3).
    - Advanced Deep Core Mining requires Mining Productivity lvl3 (from 12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.16.1
Date: 02.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed mining drills speed that was completly off.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.16.0
Date: 02.03.2019
  Changes:
    - Updated for 0.17.
    - Added mod thumbnail.
    - Removed items quickbar behavior as quickbar doesn't exists anymore (thanks pull request by Blacksmoke16 https://github.com/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/pull/3 ).
    - Updated science pack to new names for technologies.
    - Reviewed mining speed with new paradygm, should be similar speed to previous system with some introduced balancing and "batch" output.
    - Removed mining hardness from minerals and mining power from drills.
    - Deep Core Mining Drill Speed now mines 4 ores in 2 seconds (= 2/s, small nerf from 3,5/s).
    - Advanced Deep Core Mining Drill now mines 900 ore per 30 seconds (30/s from ~29/s previously) for 9 000 sulfuric acid (reduced from 90 000 for that amount previously), increased the drill liquid storage accordingly.
    - Minor locale text adjustements.
    - Renamed mod with my name to find them all more easily.
    - Todo : Refactor Deep Core Mining tool item to a GUI selection tool.
    - Todo : Maybe refactor the Deep Core Cracks spawning with a noise system.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.15.0
Date: 26.01.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed missing Angel's Ore 5 & 6 (Rubyte & Bobmnium) in an Angel's + Bob's game since 1.14.0.
    - Made all Angel's Deep Core Ores use the generic tinted icons for ores patches and refining recipes (like Bob's and Mad Clown's). It's kinda ugly for now but less confusing than using the same gfx as the base ore. Also reduces the mod's weight.
    - Rebalanced Deep Core Ore refinining to reduce all ore % depending on number of enabled ores in the game past the vanilla 5 : Angel's only -25%, Bob's and more mods -50%.
    - Rebalanced Mad Clown's ore Deep Core refining recipes (numbers taken from https://forums.factorio.com/viewtopic.php?f=185&t=58136&p=345448#p345448 ).
    - Change in : % from Crotinium/Jivolite, X ore refined from patches, Y acid required for refine, Z% from Deep Core Refine (DCR) :
    - Antitate (clowns-ore2), Pro-Galena (clowns-ore3), Orichalcite (clowns-ore4), Phosphorite (clowns-ore5) reduced by 25% from CJ reference, 100 to 75 ore refined, 50 to 37 acid, 30% DCR to 22%.
    - Sanguinate (clowns-ore6), Eliongate (clowns-ore7) reduced by 50% from C/J reference, 100 to 50 ore refined, 50 to 25 acid, 30% DCR to 15%.
    - Adamantite (clowns-ore1) reduced by 75% from CJ reference, 100 to 25 ore refined, 50 to 15 acid, 30% DCR to 7%.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.14.0
Date: 25.01.2019
  Changes:
    - Added support for Mad Clown's Extended Minerals for Angel's Bob's games, feedback welcome.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.13.2
Date: 25.01.2019
  Changes:
    - Balance : Increased Deep Core Ore Refining Focused recipes ingredient to 200 Deep Core Ore from 100 to really make them more expensive. Feedback welcome, I feel this is still too good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.13.1
Date: 23.01.2019
  Changes:
    - Fixed Bob's ore new focus recipes missing images.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Date: 22.01.2019
  Changes:
    - Happy New Year !
    - Added support for Bilka's New Game Plus worlds : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/NewGamePlus .
    - Rebalanced Ore Chunks refining : Iron 200 (=), Copper 100 (=), Stone 50 (from 100), Coal 50 (from 100), Uranium 10 (from 100).
    - New feature : Deep Core Ore Chunk Focused refining, provides a single ore chunk type but is more wasteful and yields only half the efficiency depending on the ore refining probability and result (eg. normal refining yield 10 iron chunk 30% of the time, focused refining will get 4 iron chunk all the time). Thanks November for the suggestion : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5bc50345ff1173000a26447e .
    - New recipes should be enabled on existing game saves.

  Changes:
    - Added much requested support for Bob's ores including gems and their configurations.
    - Reviewed and proper support for Angel's Refining standalone, Bob's ores standalone and Angel's Refining + Bob's Plates at the same time.
    - Major internal refactor to handle ore patches entities, recipes and items generation in a more generic way.
    - Added a generic ore gfx handling using origin's ore tint or map_color, it's not super nice looking handcrafted gfx but helps rapid support of new ores.
    - Support for Advanced Deep Core Mining for Angel's and Bob's ores, Deep Core Ore Chunk Refining output will be Angel's or Bob's ores chunks accordingly for further refining.
    - Updated some GFX to increase their shinyness significantly for Deep Core Mining Drone, refining recipes icons, Deep Core Mining Tech and mod's main icon.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.4
Date: 20.08.2018
  Changes:
    - Removed blueprint from ingredient of the Deep Core Mining Planner tool as it would take any from player inventory even if not an empty blueprint (https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5b42cd2975e71e000be52bc7 ).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.3
Date: 12.03.2018
  Changes:
    - Make use of the new "not-rotatable" entity flag. Still mod setting dependant, but it is now a startup setting. This fixes the mining drills being rotatable before placing them and not after.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.2
Date: 25.02.2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed Deep Core Mining Drills not working on Cracks and uranium patches aswell as refining processes with Angel's Petrochem reworked Sulfuric Acid liquid (sulfuric-acid > liquid-sulfuric-acid).
    - Fixed last fix fix that actually broke Planner Mining. This is Angel's Petrochem and not Angel's Refining that changes sulfuric acid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.1

    - Reimplemented rotation forcing and map labelling update saves before DCM 1.8.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.3
Date: 08.02.2018
  Changes:
    - Removed the rotation forcing and map labeling update for before DCM 1.8.2 saves as it could trigger even in later versions.
    - Rotation is still disabled by default but can be enabled in the mod opotions menu. It will only apply to new drills and existing drills placed before DCM 1.8.2 will stay rotatable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.2
Date: 07.02.2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed Angel's Ores compatibility with last changes regarding refining yield.
    - Fixed ADCMD collision box that made it un-placable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.1
Date: 05.02.2018
  Changes:
    - Reduced DCMD and ADCMD collision box a bit to make it easier to navigate around them.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed chemical plant refining ouput to handle more resulting ore as it was limited by ore stack sizes (50) instead of set outputs (100 or 200). You'll need at least 2 upgraded stack inserters to ouput Iron Chunks refining with no down time.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.0
Date: 05.02.2018
  Changes:
    - 1/ Balance pass on DCMD : (Thanks Discord Noxy#5617 for testing & feedback):
    - it proved to be too much and become a main source of ore instead of small but steady.
    - reduced mining rate by 50%, mining power from 30 to 15.
    - ore patches spawning's min range between patches increased from 5 to 10 tiles.
    - 2/ Balance pass on ADCMD : (Thanks djmad for number crunching https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5a72339966b10c000a5cf789 ):
    - it was kinda too expensive especially for iron because of mining drone cost and for coal because of sulfuric acid (if you use coal liquefaction).
    - increased Deep Core Ore iron chunks refining yield from 100 to 200.
    - reduced sulfuric acid needed for Coal and Stone chunks refining from 25 to 10/
    - reduced Deep Core Mining drone cost from 2 to 1 for Deep Core Ore refining.
  Fixes:
    - Reviewed the DCMD drill animation, should be less jittery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.2
Date: 30.01.2018
  Changes:
    - Added an "Allow rotation of DCMDs" mod setting (off by default) following popular demand. You'll need to remove and place DCMD again to make them rotatable if you set this setting to Yes.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.1
Date: 29.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Fixed new setting name and value to not be confusing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.0
Date: 29.01.2018
  Features:
    - Added beacons prevention enforcing feature(tm) (BPEF), when building a beacon near a DCMD it will be removed and droped on the ground (and vis versa). This is because beacons speed module usage on DCMD is overpowered and Deep Core Mining is overpowered enough already featuring an infinite ore source. This is however togglable in the mod options (on by default). Also existing beacons around DCMDs will not be removed as it might be too frustrating.
  Changes:
    - Internal refactoring to help code maintainability (shouldn't break things. Hopefully).
    - Fixed DCMD being fast replacable with themselves.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed math.rand potential issue when ore patches spawn when configured min richness is greater than max richness by making min = max in this case (thanks report by zelitz in https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/5a6c11b08990770009798f53 ).
    - Fixed settings sort orders.
    - Some locales fixing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.7
Date: 24.01.2018
  Changes:
    - Limited modules that can be used on DCMD and ADCMD to only efficiency and reduced from 3 to 2 slots (taking a look a beacon effects limitation aswell as it can be overpowered).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.6
Date: 23.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Fix last fix fix of previous fix's junk added by macos. Thanks macos.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.5
Date: 23.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Fix last fix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.4
Date: 22.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Critical hotfix to migration upgrade when other mods are updated and not this one. Thanks Discord Noxy#5617 for the report and fix.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.3
Date: 22.01.2018
  Changes:
    - Some local updates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.2
Date: 22.01.2018
  Changes:
    - Migration for old saves to force DCMD rotation and set all existing ore patches yield to 100% according to new paradigm. Script will notify all players and DCMD that have been affected will be marked on the map.
    - Added decoration clean up on deep core crack spawning to better see it in the world.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.1
Date: 21.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Fix vanilla crash because of angel support test.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.0
Date: 21.01.2018
  Features:
    - Adds Angel's Ore support (Angel's Refining mod). Like vanilla ores, Angels ores patches will spawn on depletion and can be manually harvested with the planner tool and refined (thanks Discord SotS#7790 for gfx help).
  Changes:
    - 1/ Major rebalance of ore patches and cracks richness amounts generation & settings. Now fixed to a value of 10 000 (= 100%) and won't deplete. This is to prevent varying mining output (richness can still be changed in mod settings).
    - 2/ Rebalance mining outputs :
    - DCMD should output a bit more than a single lane of a yellow belt but might require a chest or express splitter to keep up the mining speed.
    - ADCMD should require a full redbelt, but might work better if outputing into a chest.
    - 3/ ADCMD custom sounds improvements, now has a starting and stopping sound.
  Fixes:
    - Fixed manual mining with planner tool could fail on certain ore patches (uranium & cracks)/
    - Various internal tidying of graphics, locales fixes and code refactoring to improve maintainability.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.1
Date: 20.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Removed debugs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.0
Date: 20.01.2018
  Features:
    - New Advanced Deep Core Mining drill, bigger, expensiver and it has its own working sound. Dedicated to mine the :
    - New Deep Core Mining Cack resources that are a rare spawn in the world (~1/500 chance per chunk). Enable to mine the :
    - New Resource Deep Core Ore Chunk from DCM Cracks that must be refined in a centrifuge and will yield ore chunks that themselves require refining to get ore.
    - DCM Crack can be planner removed and require sulfuric acid to mine (like uranium).
    - Made both DCMD and ADCMD not rotatable and fixed in south orientation to match their sprite (thanks discord @Bilka#2444).
    - Both DCMD and ADCMD require a direct pump to inject sulfuric acid when mining uranium ore patch and deep core mining crack (pipes will not be enough).
  Changes:
    - Review descriptions & locales.
    - Review Technologies, now in 3 tiers with appropriate cost and requirements. Migration is done for existing saves.
    - Resorted all DCM items in inventory (should be better if not perfect).
    - Changed spawn range setting and new default is 1 (from 250) as all deep core ore resource entities can be manually harvested and removed if needed with 1.6.0 planner tool.
    - Review DCMD graphics, adds ore exit and proper pipe input.
  Fixes:
    - Sounds tuning, graphics enhancements and code improvement accross the board.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.1
Date: 14.01.2018
  Fixes:
    - Removed crash inducing migration file that shouldn't be there.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.6.0
Date: 14.01.2018
  Features:
    - New Manual Mining feature using a selection tool to select ore patches to remove.
    - Removing ore patches requires deep core mining drones and sulfuric acid barrel for uranium ore patches.
    - Removing ore patches generates ore chunks of 10% of the remaining ore patch up to a max of 1 000 (maxes out at ~300% of ore patches amount).
    - Deep Core Ore chunks require refining with sulfuric acid to get normal ore at 100 per unit.
    - Some graphics of manual mining and refining process are placeholder and may be improved later.
    - Added changelog.txt.
  Changes:
    - Split Deep Core Mining technology to unlock manual patch removing tools earlier and kept DCMD high tech.
    - Reduced default range from start from which ore patches can spawn from 250 to 1 as there is now a tool to remove them if needed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 09.01.2018
  Features:
    - Nuclear Age.
    - Added uranium ore patches and made them glow (inspiration from https://mods.factorio.com/mods/wormmus/wormmus-glowing-ores ).
    - DCMD can mine uranium ore patches and require sulfuric acid (100 from 10 for normal mining drill).
    - DCMD will need a dedicated pump to inject fluid in it.
    - DCMD now has circuit interface. Like mining drill or pumpjack can be toggled on/off and read remaining resources (like pumpjacks it will output the mining rate).
    - Added min and max for random ore patches values on spawn as a mod setting you can change (defaults from 60 000 to 300 000, same as before).
  Changes:
    - Changed DCMD ore output to better fit the sprite (you'll need to fix your existing mines).
  Fixes:
    - Fixed some translations typo & grammar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.2
Date: 26.12.2017
  Fixes:
    - Mining speed fix.
    - DCMD mining speed was bugged because of a leftover test (probably since 1.0 of the mod). Tested with the originally intended 27x more power of a normal mining drill, felt overwhelming (too much ore). It is now ~13x times faster at mining as the normal mining drill (cost unchanged, still ~16x).
    - Thanks for the report in https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/22655 .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.1
Date: 13.12.2017
  Fixes:
    - Fixed crash because of missing icon_size on some entity that is now required.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
Date: 13.12.2017
  Changes:
    - Updated for Factorio 0.16.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.1
Date: 29.11.2017
  Changes:
    - Balanced DCMD pollution as it was indeed way to high, from 1000 to 150 without module which is closer to the intended ~10-15x a normal mining drill (9 pollution). It can of course still be reduced by 80% with 3 efficiency modules 1 for ~3x pollution of a normal mining drill (30 vs 9) and ~15x an efficiency moduled mining drill (30 vs 1.8).
    - Thanks a lot for the detailed feedback in this discussion https://mods.factorio.com/mods/VortiK/vtk-deep-core-mining/discussion/19928 .
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 10.11.2017
  Features:
    - Stone age.
    - Added support for deep core mining of depleted stone with stone patches.
    - Added map-level mod runtime configurations for enabling each ore patches (iron, copper, coal, stone). All enabled by default, if disabled will prevent spawning of new ore patches when normal ore is depleted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 13.08.2017
  Changes:
    - Changed default minimum range from the start where ore patch spawn on depleted ore from 500 to 250.
    - Made the minimum spawn range a setting that can be changed in the mod options game menu.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Minor fix to Deep core mining drill selection box.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
Date: 12.08.2017
  Features:
    - Ore patches won't spawn on depleted ore in the starting zone < 500 blocs (~1-2 starting area radar size) ; it's a high tech mining solution not available until mid-endgame anyway.
    - Added shadow to the Deep core mining drill !
    - (internal) Added Factorio community Stdlib : https://github.com/Afforess/Factorio-Stdlib .
