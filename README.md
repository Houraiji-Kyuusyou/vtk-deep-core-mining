# VortiK's Deep Core Mining

Sad to see your outposts depleted and empty ore trains on your rails ? No more with Deep Core Mining ! Refactor your mining outpost to give them a new longterm breath !

This mod is designed to aleviate the "depleted ore outpost" and "need to keep building new mining outpost forever" problems without a too cheaty infinite ore solution.
- Adds a new type of equivalent ore resources patches that only spawn in place of depleted field to be mined with specific expensive drill.
- Ore Patches yields ore chunks that must be refined to get usable raw ore.
- Also adds rare cracks resources patches in the world that can be mined with an advanced endgame drill.
- DeepCore ore from cracks require a two steps heavy refining process to get usable raw ore.

The idea is to repurpose depleted mining outpost when ore is depleted. So the infrastructure is still useful for the investment of resources to replace old drills, adjusting logistics and setting up a refining facility to providing a small but steady infinite source of ore.

## Features
- New resources, ore "patches" have a small chance to spawn under depleted ore fields for Iron, Copper, Uranium, Coal and Stone and rare DeepCore Cracks spawn in the world.
- Ore patches and Cracks provide an infinite yield that stays at 100%, however they output Ore Chunks that must be refined in chemical plants to get usable raw ores.
- Ore patches and Cracks can be manually mined to free land and get a burst of resources as the cost of losing the infinite minable spot.
- High tech animated mining drill, the Deep Core Mining Drill (DCMD) is used to mine ore patches with associated technology unlock and its own intermediate component.
- DCMD is designed to be 10 times more expansive than the electric mining drill and provide 50% as much ore while using twice the energy and consuming sulfuric acid for the refining.
- Advanced Deep Core Mining Drill (ADCMD) is also animated and has custom sounds. It is used to mine Cracks that yields a specific ore that require heavy double steps refining to get useable ore. The drill will also consume Deep Core Mining drones to operate.
- ADCMD is designed to provide 30% as much ore of 10 mining drills, however it consumes tons of energy and the upkeep to make it run requires an efficient production chain to yield a positive amount of infinite ore.
- Refining of DeepCore Ore yields all existing ores in the game that are supported. Focus refining yields a single ore you can choose but is very inefficent.
- DeepCore Mining Drills with outpot tons of ore to refine. Splitters should help at low levels to handle the high ouput of the drills, however at high productivity levels it may be necessary to get creative with chests & stack inserters or one of the multiple loaders mods to keep up with the throughput :

## Mod support
- NOT compatible with Industrial Revolution : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/IndustrialRevolution
- Minor incompatibility with Filter Mining Drill mod : https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Cursed-FMD : the DCMDPlanner tool will not work to remove ore patches and patches of different ore types may spawn too close to each other.
